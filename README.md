#This React App was built using pokemon API,pure CSS & HTML

This is a simple app, all you have to do is: type a pokemon's "id" or "name (small letters)", and it will
display the pokemon's image, name, type,attack, defense, hit points (health), height, weight and effect.

## Note: you have a large range of pokemons which you can search for: from 1 to 807..!
## Besides, It will only work ONCLICK.. (doesn't work on enter button).

Enjoy!
